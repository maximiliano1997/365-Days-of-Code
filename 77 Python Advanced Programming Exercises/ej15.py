'''
15. Consider a simple number compression algorithm that works
as follows:
111155522500 -> '1....5...2..5.0..'
The algorithm goes from left to right through the number and returns an
object of str type. Each encountered digit is stored along with the number of
dots - the number of times the given digit repeats until it encounters the
next, different digit in the number.
Implement a function called compress() that compresses number as
described above.
 Examples:
[IN]: compress(1000040000) [OUT]: '1.0....4.0....1
[IN]: compress(20000000) [OUT]: '2.0 '
[IN]: compress(123456) [OUT]: '1.2.3.4.5.6.1
Tip: You can use the itertools built-in module and the groupby class in your
solution.
You just need to implement the function. The tests run several test cases to
validate the solution
'''

from itertools import groupby

# Solution


def compress(number):
    result = []
    for key, group in groupby(str(number)):
        result.append(f'{key}{"." * len(list(group))}')
    # result = ['.'.join()]

    return ''.join(result)


print(compress(11145))
print(compress(1000040000))
print(compress(20000000))
print(compress(123456))
