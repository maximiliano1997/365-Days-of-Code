# 10. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a
# product of two smaller natural numbers.
# Examples of prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, l1, 13, 17, 19, ...
# The prime number in position one is 2. The prime number in position
# two is 3. The prime number in position three is 5. Implement a
# function that returns a prime number at position 100.
# In the solution, use the function is_prime( ) from the previous
# exercise
