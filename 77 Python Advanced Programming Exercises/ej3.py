# 3. Consider the Fibonacci sequence. It is a sequence of natural
# numbers defined recursively as follows:
# • the first element of the sequence is 0
# • the second element of the sequence is 1
# • each next element of the sequence is the sum of the previous
# two elements
# The beginning of the Fibonacci sequence:
# Find the sum of all even elements of the Fibonacci sequence with
# values less than 1,000,000 (1 million).
# Present the solution in the form of a function called calculate( ) . In
# response, call calculate( ) function and print the result to the console.
# Expected result:
# 1089154
